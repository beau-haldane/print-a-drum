## Lug Settings

### Lug Type
The type of lug you are using. Regardless of whether your drum has 1 or 2 rows of lugs, take one of your lugs and count the amount of holes (attachment points) the lug has.
#### 1. Single Point
Your lug has 1 hole in the base to attach it to the drum shell.

#### 2. Double Point
Your lug has 2 holes in the base to attach it to the drum shell.

***Note:*** The lug type has nothing to do with how many tension rods fit into your lug, only the amount of holes needed to secure the lug to the shell itself.

### Lug Rows
How many rows of lugs your drum has. Double ended (lugs which fit a tension rod into each end) will always have 1 row of lugs per drum. Single ended lugs will almost always have 2 rows of lugs per drum.

***Note:*** Selecting 1 row of lugs will automatically center the lugs vertically on your shell, even if they're double point lugs.

### Lug Hole Spacing
***This setting will only show when double point lugs are selected.***

The space between hole centers of your double point lugs.

### Lug Distance From Edge
***This setting will only show when 2 lug rows are selected.***

The distance from the bearing edge to the lug hole/s. If you are using 2 rows of double point lugs, this will set the distance from the outermost holes to the bearing edge.

### Lug Screw Hole Diameter
The diameter of hole needed to fit your lug screws through.

### Lug Hole Pocket Diameter & Lug Hole Pocket Depth
A lot of lugs will have a part which protrudes from their base and locks into a hole (pocket) in the drum shell in order to keep it stable and negate shearing force on the lug screws. Enter the diameter of the protrusion, and the depth needed to fit the protrusion in these fields.
