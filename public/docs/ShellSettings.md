### Fitment Tolerance - ***Do not ignore!***
Not sure what we mean by 'fitment tolerance'? Start by watching this video:
- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnJBpCWf9Mc&t" target="_blank">Test your 3D Printer's Clearance and Tolerance - Maker's Muse</a>

You can print the tolerance testing tool in the video, however we recommend this one:
- <a href="https://www.printables.com/model/10116-printer-tolerance-test" target="_blank">Printer Tolerance Test - A-Str8</a>

Find a fitment tolerance which allows you to fit parts together snugly, while still being able to disassemble them relatively easily.

### Drum Type
The type of drum you wish to print. Currently two types are supported:
#### 1. Snare Drum
This will generate a Snare Drum shell including snare beds, and additional holes for mounting your snare strainer.

#### 2. Tom Tom
This will generate a Tom shell.

### Shell Diameter & Depth
The diameter and depth you would like your drum shell to be, measured in inches.

### Lugs
How many lugs your drum has. Unsure? Count the amount of holes in one of your hoops.

### Shell Thickness
The thickness of your drum shell in millimeters.

### Lugs Per Segment
How many lugs will fit onto 1 printed segment of your drum shell. For example, an 8 lug drum with 1 lug per segment will generate 8 segments, each comprising 1/8 of your shell circumference. The same drum with 2 lugs per shell will generate 4 segments, each comprising 1/4 of your shell circumference.

### Vent Hole Diameter
The diameter in millimeters of the drum's vent hole. Each drum shell has 1 vent hole by default. Set to 0 to remove it.
