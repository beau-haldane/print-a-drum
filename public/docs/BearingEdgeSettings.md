## Bearing Edge Settings

### Lugs Per Bearing Edge Segment
See 'Lugs Per Segment' under Shell Settings. For example, an 8 lug drum with 1 lug per segment will generate 8 segments, each comprising 1/8 of your shell circumference. The same drum with 2 lugs per shell will generate 4 segments, each comprising 1/4 of your shell circumference.

It is recommended to keep this number the same as your 'Lugs Per Segment' setting in 'Shell Settings'

### Top/Bottom Bearing Edge Settings
The following settings are identical for both the top and bottom bearing edges.

### Outer Edge Profile
The bearing edge profile for the outside edge of your bearing edge piece. There are currently four options:
- Roundover
- 45° Chamfer
- Custom Chamfer
- None

#### Roundover
A roundover or 'fillet' profile.

#### 45° Chamfer
A chamfered profile at a set angle of 45°

#### Custom Chamfer
A chamfered profile which allows you to set your own custom angle for the chamfer.

#### None
No bearing edge pofile. Commonly seen on the inside edge of Gretsch round badge drums.

### Inner/Outer Custom Chamfer Angle
***This setting will only show when Custom Chamfer is selected.***

Allows you to set the angle for your custom chamfer. Range between 0-70° with 0° being equivalent to selecting 'None' as your bearing edge profile, and 70° being quite a sharp bearing edge.

### Outer [Profile] Size
Allows you to set the apex point of your bearing edge from the outside radius of the drum shell. Cannot exceed the thickness of the bearing edges.

### Inner Edge Profile
Same options as listed in the 'Outer Edge Profile' section above.

There is no 'Inner [Profile] Size' option, as the inner profile size is calculated automatically by taking the thickness of your bearing edge piece and subtracting the value you've input for 'Outer [Profile] Size'

### Bearing Edge Thickness
Allows you to set the thickness of your bearing edge segments. Must be at least the same width as your shell segments, but can be set thicker. Thicker bearing edges are typically seen in steambent drums and can allow for a larger variety of bearing edge profiles.
